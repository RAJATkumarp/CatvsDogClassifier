2. Preprocess images using OpenCV (resize, flatten, etc.).
3. Train ML models: SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-means
Clustering.
4. Save the trained models.
5. Build a Flask backend to load models and handle image uploads.
6. Create a frontend with HTML/CSS for uploading images and selecting models.
7. Display the classification result on the webpage.
